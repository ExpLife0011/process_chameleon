Process Chameleon
==========
This is my "lil_calc" PoC presented on the video:<br/>
[Test with ProcessExplorer vs TaskManager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3iCZ3BKkLk)<br/>
It is not FUD, but it can fool some tools and it can be used as a test case.</br>
The process overwrites it's own PEB to create an illusion, that it has been loaded from a different path.
